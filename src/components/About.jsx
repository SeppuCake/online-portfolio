        I graduated from German-Malaysian Institute with Diploma in Network Security where I learned through Cisco Networking Academy and the basics of programming languages such as Python, HTML, PHP, Java, and SQL. While learning cybersecurity and achieved Cisco Certified Networking Associate (CCNA), I self taught in learning more in developing simple web development and challenge myself in learning new things. I have always been intrigued with technology especially computers. I started tinkering with computers at a very young age. My hobbies outside of coding are playing video games, creating content through video editing, and cooking. With interest in video games and creating content, I try incorporate my interests in self-teaching myself with learning programming languages such as familiarizing with Unity and Java.
